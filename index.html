		<h3> About the creator of this Restaurant </h3>
		
		<p class="purple">Hello! My name is Johnny Colonna, and I have been a picky 
			eater for my entire life. I don't usually enjoy trying new foods becuase
			if I don't enjoy it then i feel as if I've wasted my money! I decided to
			create this restaurant for people like me that just want to get down to the
			basic and just enjoy some simple foods, at a fairly low price. As a certified 
			picky eater, I can assure you that everything on the menu is as simple as it
			can get. And if you are unsure if there are certain ingredients, feel free
			to ask our expertly trained picky eater staff. We look forward to cooking some
			simple dishes for you!</p>
			<p class="purple">Sincerly,</p>
			<p class="purple">Johnny, Founder of the Picky Emporium</p>
